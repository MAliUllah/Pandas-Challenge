Grade 11 students at Holden High School holds a higher average Math score (85) comparing all schools and grades. Holden High School grade 12 students possess a higher average reading score (84.698795).

The other irregular finding of this analysis is that when the budget per student increases student's average math score, the average reading score, percent of passing math, percent of passing reading, and the overall passing decreases. This finding commences investigating the real motivators for academic achievement, and give an open space for researchers to work on this more.

The data revealed that when the number of students sizes higher in schools the average math scores, average reading scores, passing math, passing reading, and overall passing decrease. So, we can infer that, when student size rises, it negatively influences student achievement. Therefore, schools, cities, districts, and charters should work on student size in schools, and classes because it directly affects student achievement for so many reasons.
